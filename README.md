[![Docker](https://github.com/JzJad/rpi-checkmk/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JzJad/rpi-checkmk/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

## Current version: 2.2.0p22 (Updates on hold)

As mentioned on [chrisss404's](https://github.com/chrisss404/check-mk-arm) readme, there is an official commitment to add support for certain ARM architectures by Checkmk: [Checkmk â€“ our road to ARM support.](https://checkmk.com/blog/checkmk-our-road-arm-support) as this is the case they have retired the project, as such there will be no more updates to the base image at this moment. I may test in place upgrades later, or you can your self.
